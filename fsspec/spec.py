    Notes
    -----
    Instances are cached according to

    * The values of the class attributes listed in `_extra_tokenize_attributes`
    * The arguments passed to ``__init__``.

    This creates an additional reference to the filesystem, which prevents the
    filesystem from being garbage collected when all *user* references go away.
    A call to the :meth:`AbstractFileSystem.clear_instance_cache` must *also*
